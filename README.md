## Problem Statement

This Dashboard helps to understand the full year of choclate sales 
along with KPI's of Total Sales,Total Cost,Total Proft,Total Boxes,Total Shipments

A detailed table highlights salesperson performance â€” identifying those who met, almost met, or did not meet their targets.
A similar analysis is done for products, showing sales and profit by product and whether they achieved their targets.

A line chart illustrates month-over-month trends in sales, enabling quick identification of seasonal patterns.

Slicers allow users to filter data by Product Category and Country for more focused analysis.

A column chart displays the number of boxes sold alongside total shipments (e.g., shipments of 20 boxes, 40 boxes, etc.), helping visualize product distribution scale.
